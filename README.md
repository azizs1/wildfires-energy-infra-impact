# Modeling the Spread of Wildfires and Assessing Urban Energy Infrastructure Vulnerability
**Authors:** Aziz Shaik and Nicholas Cheung
**Course:** CS 5834: Intro to Urban Computing (Fall 2025)

This project explores the use of urban computing techniques to model the spread of wildfires and evaluate the risk to critical energy infrastructure.

## How to Use
Put information on how to use the code

## Acknowledgments
- We use the [2.3 Million Wildfires](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/braddarrow/23-million-wildfires) dataset uploaded to Kaggle by Brad Darrow and originally compiled by Karen Short for wildfire data.
- We use the following HIFLD datasets published on Kaggle by Behrooz Sohrabi for energy infrastructure data:
  - [US Electric Power Plants](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behroozsohrabi/us-electric-power-plants)
  - [US Electric Power Transmission Substations](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behroozsohrabi/us-electric-power-transmission-substations)
  - [US Electric Power Transmission Lines](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behroozsohrabi/us-electric-power-transmission-lines)
